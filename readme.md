Yeoman Generator (Moda fork, modified) for Gumby 2.6 Framework using Assemble.io and RequireJS
========================================================================

## Usage

- Prerequisites:

	- node (latest) installed globally
	- npm installed globally
	- Ruby
	- Sass
	- Compass (tbd what extra notes might apply here)
	- Modular Scale
	- Sassy Math

	
<!-- Install it (only once): `npm install -g generator-gumby-assemble`-->
Install yo and generator-generator: `npm install -g yo generator-generator`


Clone this repo into your desired generator directory (not the directory from which you'll end up working):

  
    $ mkdir gumby-assemble-generator
    $ cd gumby-assemble-generator
    $ git clone https://github.com/moda-schneij/generator-gumby-assemble-moda.git

- Create a global npm link to use the generator on your machine: `npm link`
	
- Return to your sites folder, create a new folder, and cd into it:


    $ cd /sites
    $ mkdir gumby-assemble
    $ cd gumby-assemble

- Run `yo gumby-assemble-moda`

- Run `grunt` to build and `grunt server` to preview



## Options

* `--skip-install`

  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after
  scaffolding has finished.

* `--test-framework=[framework]`

  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for
  another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.
